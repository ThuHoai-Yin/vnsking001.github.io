                            1 The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor

                            (q.v. for pre-1947 history)
                            of the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars
                            must
                            meet. Formula One was a
                            new formula agreed upon during 1946 after World War II, with the first non-championship
                            races
                            taking place that year.
                            The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number of Grand Prix racing
                            organisations had laid out rules
                            for a world championship before the war, but due to the suspension of racing during the
                            conflict, the World Drivers'
                            Championship did not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship race took
                            place
                            at Silverstone in the
                            United Kingdom in 1950. A championship for constructors followed in 1958. National
                            championships
                            existed in South Africa
                            and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held by
                            promoters
                            for many years, but due to
                            the increasing cost of competition, the last of these occurred in 1983.
